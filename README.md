# 🚀 RustPulse: Mission-Critical Server Monitoring in Rust

> Originally inspired by aerospace-grade reliability, **RustPulse** is a fast, secure, and production-ready backend system for monitoring server health in real-time. It brings the discipline of fault-tolerant, deterministic systems to modern infrastructure — from cloud servers to critical operations.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
Create a fully modular, production-grade Rust backend that provides real-time system metrics, secure API access, and a robust DevOps pipeline — all implemented using Hexagonal Architecture and Test-Driven Development.

## 🧱 Week 1 – Project Bootstrapping & Architecture Overview

**🎯 Goal:** Set up the foundational RustPulse project structure with initial routes, logging, and observability baseline.

### ✅ Features Implemented
- Project initialized using `cargo`
- Logging to file with `tracing_appender`
- Optional JSON log format via `.env` (`LOG_JSON=1`)
- `/health` endpoint (liveness probe)
- Root route `/` with startup log message
- `.env` includes `DATABASE_URL`, `RUST_LOG`, and `LOG_JSON`

### 🧰 Tooling
| Tool                | Purpose                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Axum                | Web framework                |
| Tokio               | Async runtime                |
| tracing             | Structured logging           |
| tracing-subscriber  | Log filtering & formatting   |
| dotenvy             | Load .env config             |
| tower-http          | HTTP middleware              |

### 🌐 Router Design
- `routes.rs` mounts all routes
- Scalable structure for REST, GraphQL, and auth

### 📆 Next: Week 2
- Create domain models: `Server`, `Metric`
- Initialize `AppState`
- Load `.env` into `config.rs`

📌 *This README updates weekly to reflect live project development.*


## 🧱 Week 2 – Domain Modeling & SQLx Setup

**🎯 Goal:** Define domain entities and integrate async PostgreSQL connection using `sqlx`.

### ✅ Features Implemented
- Defined core domain models: `Server`, `Metric` (with `Uuid`, `IpAddr`, `DateTime`, `Duration`)
- Integrated `dotenvy` for loading environment variables from `.env`
- Parsed `DATABASE_URL` and connected via `PgPoolOptions`
- Configured structured logging with `tracing_subscriber` and optional JSON format
- Explored `.env` runtime loading behavior based on workspace vs. crate path

### 🧰 Tooling
| Tool        | Purpose                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| sqlx        | Async DB access with compile-time safety |
| uuid        | Unique identifiers for models        |
| chrono      | Timestamps and durations             |
| dotenvy     | Load environment variables            |
| tracing     | Structured logs                      |
| tracing-subscriber | Log output and formatting     |

### 🚧 In Progress
- Database creation (manual or migration)
- Initial schema and migration setup using `sqlx-cli`
- Injecting DB pool into `AppState` for shared access

### 📌 Notes
- PostgreSQL must be manually created before connecting
- Connection `.await` should use `?` and proper error handling (`main() -> Result`)
- Running from the crate root (`cd bac

🧭 How to publish docs like a pro — step by step
🦀 1. Make sure your crate is ready
Your Cargo.toml must have:
toml
CopyEdit
[package]name = "your_crate_name"version = "0.1.0"edition = "2021"description = "What your crate does"license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"repository = "https://github.com/yourname/your_crate"documentation = "https://docs.rs/your_crate"
documentation = is optional but good practice
🔐 2. Get an API token from crates.io
Go to 

Click "New Token"
Copy the token
🛠️ 3. Login once from CLI
bash
CopyEdit
cargo login YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
📦 4. Publish your crate
bash
CopyEdit
cargo publish
This:
Uploads your crate to crates.io
Automatically triggers docs.rs to build your docs
In minutes, your docs are live at:
arduino
CopyEdit
https://docs.rs/your_crate_name
📎 Optional: Test your docs before publishing
Run:
bash
CopyEdit
cargo doc --open
This builds the docs locally and opens them in your browser — exactly like what users will see on docs.rs.
🚨 Bonus: Add a docs badge in your README.md
