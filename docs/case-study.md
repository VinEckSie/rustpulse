üß† Case Study Outline: RustPulse ‚Äì Real-Time Monitoring for Mission-Critical Systems
1. üö© Problem Statement (Motivation & Challenge)
Why did you build this? What pain points or limitations does it solve?
Content ideas:
Real-time monitoring tools are often bloated, slow, or non-secure.
Companies in high-stakes industries (e.g., simulation, real-time ops) need low-latency insights.
Many existing tools don‚Äôt offer a lightweight, installable desktop version or are tied to the cloud.
2. üéØ Objectives & Constraints (Project Scope)
What were your goals? What did you decide not to include and why?
Content ideas:
Full Rust stack, no Node, no JS, no Python.
Real-time dashboard + API without relying on cloud/SaaS platforms.
Focus on performance, observability, and resilience, not hardware (no embedded yet).
No vendor lock-in: the user runs the system locally or self-hosts.
3. üß± Architecture Overview (System Design)
Show that you can think like an engineer. Include diagrams or sketches.
Content ideas:
Modular design: telemetry collector, API, alert engine, dashboard.
Backend built with Actix + gRPC for performance.
PostgreSQL for historical data + analysis.
Tauri + Plotters for native dashboard.
Dockerized setup with rolling update strategy.
‚úÖ Include a block screenshot or diagram of components:

4. ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack Breakdown (Why Each Tool Was Chosen)
For each component, explain why you chose that technology ‚Äî from a performance, security, or simplicity angle.



Component
Stack
Why?
Backend
Actix Web
High-performance async REST
Communication
Tonic (gRPC)
Binary, low-latency telemetry
DB Layer
Diesel + PostgreSQL
Strong typing + reliability
Async
Tokio
Concurrency without complexity
UI
Tauri + Plotters
Rust-native, secure, lightweight
Logging
Tracing
Structured logs for observability
Auth
JWT (jsonwebtoken)
Stateless, secure, industry standard
CI/CD
GitHub Actions + Clippy
Dev-quality & consistency
Deployment
Docker + Rolling Update
Reproducible & safe updates

5. üîí Security & Fault Tolerance (Resilience is Key)
Show that you think beyond the "happy path".
Topics:
JWT auth + rate limiting
Log rotation + trace layering
Config validation + fail-safe behavior
Avoiding panics with anyhow, thiserror
Graceful shutdowns
6. üìä UI/UX Philosophy (Dashboard Design)
Discuss your UX decisions like an engineer, not a designer.
Ideas:
Responsive and native-feeling with Tauri
Dark/light theme for operator visibility
Real-time chart updates with Plotters
Keyboard-first UX for rapid interaction
Alerts displayed visually + with notification banners
7. üìê Testing & Dev Experience (Professional Touch)
Show rigor here ‚Äî it‚Äôs what makes you portfolio-ready.
Topics:
Integration tests for critical paths
Mock database with sqlx::test
Linting + Clippy enforcement
Use of .env + dotenvy for config injection
Separate dev, test, prod build flows (if any)
8. üß† Challenges & Lessons Learned (Transparency = Credibility)
Be honest and technical.
Examples:
Complexity of gRPC streams in Rust
Diesel‚Äôs steep learning curve vs productivity gain
Debugging async tracing logs
Tauri quirks on Mac/Linux
Choosing Plotters over alternatives
9. üí• Results & Performance (Back it up with numbers)
If you have benchmarks or performance logs ‚Äî drop them here.
Ideas:
API response time under load
Dashboard frame rate at 100+ updates/sec
RAM footprint of full app running
PostgreSQL write throughput under stress
10. üß≠ Next Steps / Future Work (Vision)
Ideas:
Add custom metric providers (e.g., GPU, external sensors)
Add WebSocket channel for live push instead of polling
Export metrics in OpenMetrics format
Multi-node dashboard (one UI for many servers)
Later: plugin interface for aerospace telemetry feed
11. üì∏ Screenshots, Code Snippets, and GitHub Repo
Make it visual, code-centric, and clickable:
Screenshot of dashboard in dark/light mode
Screenshot of CLI log with tracing
Code snippets of key modules (tracing, router, alerts)
GitHub badge: build status, coverage, etc.
Link to README (with an engaging one-liner)
