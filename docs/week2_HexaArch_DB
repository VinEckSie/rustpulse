## 📅 Week 2 Progress – Domain & Database Setup

**✅ Goals this week:**
- [x] Define core domain models: `Server` and `Metric`
- [x] Load `.env` file with `dotenvy`
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL connection with `sqlx`
- [x] Configure structured logging using `tracing` and `tower_http`
- [ ] Create and connect to `rustpulse` database
- [ ] Implement SQL migrations and DB schema

**🔧 Stack involved:**
- `sqlx` with PostgreSQL (async database connection)
- `dotenvy` for environment config loading
- `tracing` + `tower_http` for structured HTTP logging
- `uuid` + `chrono` for typed model fields

**📝 Notes:**
The PostgreSQL database is not fully created yet.  
Next steps include:
- Creating the `rustpulse` database manually or via migration
- Defining and running the initial schema using `sqlx migrate`
